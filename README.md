# Starwars App
  
  Starwars app is a small app to search a star war character and see details of the character.
  
  ## API
  
  (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and programmatically accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!
  
  ```bash
  https://swapi.dev/
  ```
  
  ## Tech Stack Used
  * MVVM
  * Live Data
  * Navigation
  * Coroutines
  * Dagger Hilt
  * Data Binding
  * Mockito
  * Clean Architecture
  
  ## Why this tech stack?
  MVVM is easy to code, works like charm with UI bindings, easily testable, does not hold a reference to the view, lifecycle aware.LiveData works well with view models and is lifecycle aware, easy to update UI with bindings. Navigation is a newly introduced stack that makes life easier to maintain backstacks and UI navigations with the use of nav graphs. Coroutines are Kotlin's way of using threads which are lightweight and a great match for asynchronous programming. Hilt is a new and good dependency injection framework. Clean architecture gives us a clear separation of concerns, follows the SOLID principle, and helps write good maintainable code.
  
  ## Control Flow
  Fragment -> ViewModel -> Usecase -> Repository -> 
  Remote Data Source -> API Service
  
  Here layers are as below
  
  * Fragment & ViewModel - PRESENTATION
  * Usecase - DOMAIN
  * Repository & Remote Data Source & API Service - DATA
  
  Mappers are used to convert data whenever it travels from one layer to other.
  
  ## How do I add <something>?
  
  Fragment -> in package /presentation/ui create your Fragment and add the corresponding viewmodel to it.Add dependency for your view model in /presentation/di/AppModule.kt. Do not forget to add your fragment to the nav_graph under src/main/res/navigation along with arguments and actions.
  
  UseCase -> add your usecase in /domain/usecase which extends BaseUseCase and make a call to the repository in executeusecase
  
  Repository -> add an interface of your repository in /domain/repository and then add implementation of this interface in /data/repository
  
  New API -> add new service endpoint in /data/source/remote/service/ApiService.kt 
  
  ***Do not forget to add tests in their respective folders under src/test.
  
  ## What can be improved?
  * Does not support local storage. 
  * UI can be improved.
  * API service response can be wrapped around a proper Response class that checks for HTTP errors.
  * UI is not tested.
